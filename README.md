# 🔥“50 Days of SQL ( Basic )🔍 | The Query Quest Begins”🔥
## 🚀 Starting My 50-Day SQL Challenge! 🧠💻

 I've decided to take on a 50-day self-learning challenge focused purely on SQL — the language behind data-driven decision-making.

Each day, I’ll explore a new SQL concept, solve real problems, and post bite-sized learnings, visual dashboards, or query breakdowns. My goal?

 🎯 Sharpen my data querying skills.

 🎯 Build consistency.

 🎯 Inspire others to level up too.



## 👇 How I’ll Do It:

🗓️ 50 Days — One SQL topic or problem per day

 📚 Topics — Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Subqueries, Optimization & more

 📈 Sharing — Regular LinkedIn posts with insights, visuals & code snippets

 🏷️ Hashtag — Follow along using #50DaysOfSQL
